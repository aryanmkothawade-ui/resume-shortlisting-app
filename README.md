Resume Shortlisting & Optimization Platform
ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

Hiring companies face the challenge of going through hundreds or even thousands of resumes for a single job opening. Manually shortlisting resumes is inefficient, time-consuming, and prone to human bias. Similarly, professionals often struggle to tailor their resumes according to specific company requirements, leading to missed opportunities.

ðŸ’¡ Proposed Solution

We propose a dual-use platform that benefits both companies and candidates:

1. Resume Shortlisting for Companies

Companies can upload their requirements (e.g., skills, experience, expected salary range, certifications).

The system intelligently scans and matches candidate resumes from the database.

Companies receive the most relevant shortlisted resumes, saving time and improving hiring efficiency.

2. Resume Optimization for Candidates

Candidates can upload their resumes and specify the job/company they want to apply for.

The system suggests improvements in skills, keywords, formatting, and missing information.

This increases the chances of getting shortlisted.

ðŸŽ¯ Benefits

For Companies: Saves time, reduces manual effort, and ensures better candidate matching.

For Candidates: Helps create a company-tailored resume and improves hiring chances.

For Both: A fair, faster, and smarter recruitment process.
